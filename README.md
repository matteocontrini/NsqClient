# NsqClient [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/NsqClient?color=success)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NsqClient) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/matteocontrini/NsqClient?color=success)](https://github.com/matteocontrini/NsqClient/blob/master/LICENSE)

A basic .NET Standard 2.0 library for interacting with [NSQ](https://nsq.io/).
 
Publishing and subscribing to topics are both supported, with automatic reconnection in case of network errors or failures.

**NOTE**: this project is still considered beta. It will be used in production in the next months, though, so expect the status to be updated in the near future.

## Usage

An example is available [here](https://github.com/matteocontrini/NsqClient/blob/master/NsqClient.Example/Program.cs). No more docs for now, sorry.
